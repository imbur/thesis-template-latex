Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisors, Ákos Horváth and Zoltán Ujhelyi for their continuous support and invaluable advices throughout my work.

Besides my advisors, I thank Gábor Szárnyas for all the precious help with the Train Benchmark framework, and data visualization.

Finally, I would like to thank the staff working for DigitalOcean for providing me a multi-core virtual machine to run Train Benchmark.
